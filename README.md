# Snakie
## snake like game for console  

This is one of older code, one of first attempts with ncurses and writing a game. 

![snakie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dalhorinek/snakie/master/screenshot.png "snakie game")

It's a simple console game.

## INSTALL

You have to install ncurses and ncurses-dev packages. 

### Building 

This is working on **Linux**, **Mac OS X** and probably on any system where ncurses and posix threads work. 

Checkout the repository and run `make`
This will generate a `snakie` exectuable file, so simply run it 

```
./snakie 
```

And that's all
